The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

{% highlight ruby %}
=begin
definition of the prime factor: In number theory, the prime factors of a positive integer are the prime
	numbers that divide that integer exactly. A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1
	that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
iterate from 2 through 13195 and if conditions are met add them into the answer array
conditions
1. 13195 % i == 0
2. 
=end
# arr = []
# i = 2
num = 600851475143
# while i <= num
# 	if num % i == 0
# 		arr << i
# 	end
# 	i += 1
# end
=begin
new_list.last, after creating a new list after selecting prime numbers only out of the existing array, arr.
a prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
when the candidate number is divided by 1..itself, (% == 0) values are only 1 and itself.
=end
# new_arr = []
# arr.each do |i|
# 	(2...i).each do |j|
# 		new_arr << i if i % j == 0
#  	end
# end
# answer = arr - new_arr
# puts answer.last
require 'prime'
# arr.keep_if { |x| x.prime? == true }
# puts arr
puts num.prime_division

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
