Full-stack Web Developer at Discovery Communications, Inc. On a daily basis, I speak JavaScript (React) and PHP (Laravel) to develop/maintain enterprise web applications being used in Discovery. Specifically, I closely work with ETL/BI veterans in Data & Analytics, Global Technology & Operations. My role within the team covers the whole gamut of software development: from ideation to deployment to production environment. My biggest satisfaction of my job is to see users happy with the applications that I built.

With regards to technical expertise, I identify myself as a JavaScript/PHP expert who understands ins and outs of those programming languages of the Web. I also have a solid understanding of UX best practices, Object Oriented Programming, Object Oriented Analysis and Design, Cloud Computing, NoSQL Databases, and Distributed Systems. Although I am most comfortable with JavaScript and PHP, I am technology-agnostic and passionate about learning new things.

- Front-end: JavaScript (React, AngularJS/Ionic and Backbone), CSS (Bootstrap) and HTML
- Back-end: JavaScript (Node/Express), PHP (Laravel), Java, Ruby, and Python
- Databases: SQL, Oracle 11g, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, and Redis
- Tools: Git/Github, Heroku, and Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- CI/CD: Docker, Jenkins and Ansible

The followings are the types of industries/clients I have worked with.
