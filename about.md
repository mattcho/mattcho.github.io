I love languages, and I think my love of languages led me here where I am. I was born in South Korea and grew up there but now I live in Washington DC developing web applications during the weekdays and teaching jazz piano on the weekends. Before having this very satisfying routine, I worked at the World Bank located in Washington DC as Business Analyst, which led me to go for learning computer programming. Before that I did not know much about programming: I was a business person moonlighting as a musician in South Korea. To me, computer programming and jazz piano looked similar in essence because both are based on languages. I am enjoying my life in both fields.
